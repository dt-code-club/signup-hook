# Overview
This is the system that catches Typeform webhooks when a new member registers for DT Code Club. It works with a Firebase database and our `auto-email` system to send email to newly signed-up users as well.

# Maintenance
For future executive teams, I (aaronw-dev) recommend that you have at least one executive member that can do maintenance, bug fixes etc. on our code systems (e.g. website, auto-email, signup-hook).

This system uses Vercel to deploy it. Please send me a DM on Discord or send me an email at [me@awdev.co](mailto:me@awdev.co) if you want access to it.
